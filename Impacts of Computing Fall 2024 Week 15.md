Now that you are deeply engaged in your projects, it's time for another update from each of you (along with the feedback you provide one another).

As a reminder, here are the key pieces of this Final Project.

- **Aims of the Project**. This project is designed to have you demonstrate and extend your understanding of and engagement with the key concepts of this course, such as ***ethical frameworks***, ***collective responsibility***, and ***moral taint*** and how they can be applied to a topic pertaining to the impacts of computing of your choosing.
- **Depth of the Project**. You have three to four weeks (about 25% of the semester) to work on and share your project. Additionally, per the syllabus, the Final Project is worth 40% of your final grade for the course. This is just a quantitative way of saying that this project is intended and expect to involve a substantive amount of work on your part.
- **Getting Support**. I am willing and eager to support you as you develop, research, and compile this project. We can do that in many ways, including via email, messages on Mattermost, or meeting by phone, Teams, Zoom, or even in Mattermost (which has a conferencing feature I am dying to try out). Do not hesitate to reach out at any point. Also, I am available to review your work in progress if that would be helpful.


#### Here is the work for Week 15:

1. **Introduction to Week 15** - This week will have the same structure as last week. So, here is the brief intro to Week 14 as a reminder, if needed.

2. ***Readings/Listenings/Viewings***

As was the case last week, any readings/listenings/viewings you do this week will be determined by your Final Project. I will likely share things that I come across that I consider interesting or relevant. What you do with these are entirely up to you.

3. ***Interactions***

As you work on your Final Projects, I think it is really important to stay connected with one another, therefore I am asking you to ***share your progress*** with us via Mattermost using the **Final Projects** channel.

Here are some prompts for these updates:

- How has your project evolved over the past week?
- What have you worked on this week?
- What have you come across this week that has surprised you the most?
- What are you next steps?

***Be sure to interact with one another about your progress updates as well***.

This work is due by the end of the day on **Monday, December 16**.
