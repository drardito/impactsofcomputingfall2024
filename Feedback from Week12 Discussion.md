I have had the pleasure of reading through your discussion from Week 12, where you used the evidence from notifications, etc., to speculate on who your computing systems understood you to be. Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction/Substance***. So much of what you discussed had to with imbalances of power and the impact exerted on us. Here are some highlights:

   

   ***AI, Healthcare, and Privacy***

   @livmeyer At first glance, AI in healthcare makes sense. It can keep track of a person's health and collect patient data without exhausting human doctors. It can also help to predict diagnoses and recommend treatment plans. However, it obviously has concerns when it comes to the accuracy of its predictions and if it will replicate the prejudices we observed in the readings about AI in the criminal justice system.

   @stefaniewhitmer Unlike with other AII like predictive ad placements or suggested posts, I don’t have an issue with my data being used to train AI models for healthcare purposes. Obviously as long as my personal information is obscured and used in aggregate with other people, I think that using machine learning to analyze patterns could really improve medical research in a significant way.

   @denise I think that while AI can be used in a bad way, there are also some helpful ways that AI can be used to help others, especially those in the medical field, which allows them for early detection, virtual training, and virtual healthcare.

   @timponeg My thing is, are we really trusting AI to “take over” our healthcare system? What happened to physical, human, on hands, studies and research. What happens when and if there is a possible glitch in a system. We are dealing with the health of human beings.

   

2. ***Visualizations.*** As you now know, I like to use computational tools to *analyze* these types of discussions. I think in a course of the Impacts of Computing, it makes sense (and for possibly interesting discussion) to use these types of computational tools. For this week (and throughout the course), I used/will use [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is a powerful tool designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  By looking at these features of your writing, it is possible to learn some high level characteristics of your work. ***Volume of writing*** is a measurement of the quantity of your collective writing. For this week, you collectively used about 4100 words, which represents a big decrease from the previous Mattermost discussion (about 5800 words). This is surprising, as most of you had very substantive posts in response to this week's texts. Maybe your writing was dense an succinct. Additionally, about 1000 of the terms you used were unique, which is an increase over last week's discussions. ***Vocabulary density*** is a measure of how rich or varied the vocabulary is in a given text or corpus. A vocabulary density of 0.255 means that, on average, about 26% of the words in the corpus are unique. This is slightly higher than last time, and this makes sense since many of you were talking about the same kinds of AI on healthcare and data privacy.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. As mentioned above, the most frequently used (largest) terms reflect on the common set of notifications/evidence you cited in your post: *healthcare*, *health*, *ai*, and *people*. As usual, we see the relatively high frequency of the word *pm*, which is taken from the date/time stamp in Mattermost.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* As usual, I performed a ***collocation analysis***, in which we can look at the relationships between works used in your Mattermost posts. In this visualization, thicker grey lines indicate a higher number of connections between terms. I invite you to explore a [live version of this analysis]https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=fd278d796b41dbeeb836aaafae6e6faa&query=ai&query=healthcare&query=used&query=help&query=health&query=systems&query=video&query=intelligence&query=impact&query=artificial&query=pm&query=november&query=agree&query=wilmerroldan&query=pisapiat&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph), which will allow you to explore these connections in interesting ways. Note the range of connected terms here, which is reflective of the focus on AI, healthcare, and corporations in this week's texts. Please do play with the live version. I think you will be surprised by the connections you see there.

4. Topic Modeling. For the first time this semester, I used Voyant-Tools to do what is called *topic modeling*, which it defines this way: *The Topics tool is designed to help you understand what topics (term clusters) exist and how they are distributed. To simplify, words in each document are randomly assigned to a specified number of topics (you can determine the number of topics). The algorithm then goes through a number of iterations (50) and tries to refine the model of which terms are best suited to which topics (based on co-occurrence in the documents). It's important to understand that this algorithm starts by randomly assigning words to topics and so every time topic modelling is run you are likely to get different results. Each topic technically contains every word in the corpus, but only the top 10 words are displayed. The order of the words is important and the first words likely contribute much more to the topic than the latter words.*

There are some components of this analysis which seem very coherent with the others, and some not so much. I am very eager to hear your responses to this type of analysis.

Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 12 discussion on Mattermost.
