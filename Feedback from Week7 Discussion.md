I have had the pleasure of reading through your discussion from Week 7, where you used the evidence from notifications, etc., to speculate on who your computing systems understood you to be. Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction/Substance***. So much of what you discussed had to with imbalances of power and the impact exerted on us. Here are some highlights:

   

   ***What does it mean to be connected?***
   @michelleb - Social media has influenced the collective moral standards of individuals by influencing many to align their behavior with others online.

   @amelillo2 - By technology connecting one another, it forces people to behave in a way they never have, but they do it because everyone else is doing it. 

   

   ***Who is responsible?***
   @cole.patterson - While the articles from this week show how groups of people must be held collectively morally responsible for the consequences of their decisions. It is true that this data collection enables a company like Meta to train their algorithm and provide you the most interesting posts to look at, but the company has to also be held accountable for the pitfalls of that data collection. 

   @orlandoa1 - I now see it more as a bigger picture, where members work together as a corporation/ group and monitor our everyday life, violating our rights and privacy. Not only are our protection is being violated, lies are being thrown around for content and clickbait

   

   ***How are we affected/impacted?***

   @pisapiat - The outcomes produced by AI can be manipulated to present a reality that may later be proven baseless or fabricated â€“ similar, to the obituary webpage scenario. 

   @emilyramon (in response to @carlos0918) -  If people can have fake obituaries created on their behalf what's stopping companies from using people's information to falsify reviews.

   

2. ***Visualizations.*** As you now know, I like to use computational tools to *analyze* these types of discussions. I think in a course of the Impacts of Computing, it makes sense (and for possibly interesting discussion) to use these types of computational tools. For this week (and throughout the course), I used/will use [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is a powerful tool designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  By looking at these features of your writing, it is possible to learn some high level characteristics of your work. ***Volume of writing*** is a measurement of the quantity of your collective writing. For this week, you collectively used about 6700 words, which represents a large increase from the previous Mattermost discussion (about 4700 words). This makes sense in two ways: 1) you were summarizing a large-ish set of data, and then speculating on what it meant and then commenting upon one another's posts. Additionally, about 1300 of the terms you used were unique, which is also an increase from the last round. ***Vocabulary density*** is a measure of how rich or varied the vocabulary is in a given text or corpus. A vocabulary density of 0.194 means that, on average, about 20% of the words in the corpus are unique. This is about 5% lower than last time, and this makes sense since many of you were talking about the same kinds of notifications/evidence (e.g., *ads*, *notifications*, and *systems*).

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. As mentioned above, the most frequently used (largest) terms reflect on the common set of notifications/evidence you cited in your post: *systems*, *ads*, *based*, and *computing*. As usual, we see the relatively high frequency of the word *pm*, which is taken from the date/time stamp in Mattermost.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* As usual, I performed a ***collocation analysis***, in which we can look at the relationships between works used in your Mattermost posts. In this visualization, thicker grey lines indicate a higher number of connections between terms. I invite you to explore a [live version of this analysis](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=35f7ae8e563629cffa5cfec3a99f19b1&query=ads&query=week&query=new&query=notifications&query=lot&query=things&query=like&query=think&query=know&query=based&query=computing&query=systems&query=i%27m&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph), which will allow you to explore these connections in interesting ways. Be sure to look at the connections between the terms *notification*, *based*, *computing*, and *things*.  Please do play with the live version. I think you will be surprised by the connections you see there.

4. Topic Modeling. For the first time this semester, I used Voyant-Tools to do what is called *topic modeling*, which it defines this way: *The Topics tool is designed to help you understand what topics (term clusters) exist and how they are distributed. To simplify, words in each document are randomly assigned to a specified number of topics (you can determine the number of topics). The algorithm then goes through a number of iterations (50) and tries to refine the model of which terms are best suited to which topics (based on co-occurrence in the documents). It's important to understand that this algorithm starts by randomly assigning words to topics and so every time topic modelling is run you are likely to get different results. Each topic technically contains every word in the corpus, but only the top 10 words are displayed. The order of the words is important and the first words likely contribute much more to the topic than the latter words.*

There are some components of this analysis which seem very coherent with the others, and some not so much. I am very eager to hear your responses to this type of analysis.

Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 7 discussion on Mattermost.
