The goal of this week is to explore the idea of ***Collective Moral Responsibility***, which arose in part from your discussions in Week 4 and in part from deepening our exposure to ethical and moral frameworks with which to think. So, it is the right time to expand our ethical focus from the individual to the collective.


#### Here is the work for Week 5:

1. ***Introduction to Week 5*** - Please listen this to brief audio introduction to Week 5.


2. ***Readings/Viewings***

Read these three texts:

* IEP (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy), [Collective Moral Responsibility](https://iep.utm.edu/collective-moral-responsibility/) [This is a little chunky, but hang in there]
* Jef Ausloos , Jill Toh , Alexandra Giannopoulou, [The case for collective action against the harms of data-driven technologies](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/blog/collective-action-harms/) [from our new friends at the Ada Lovelace Institute]
* Mia Sato, [The unsettling scourge of obituary spam](https://www.theverge.com/24065145/ai-obituary-spam-generative-clickbait) [very odd case study of AI impacting human life]

As you do so, please read them from (at least) two perspectives:

- ***What (if anything) is different about viewing ethical issues from a collective/networked perspective***? What does collective moral responsibility mean? Who is a member of which collective? What is the balance between individual and collective responsibility?

- ***In what ways are data about you and I being used or possible abused? What do our computing systems know about us and how do they know these things?*** Give some thought, too, to the ethical implications of these uses of tracking/surveillance technologies.

As you are reading these articles, please continue take notes using the document and/or folder you created as a part of the work for previous weeks.  As I have said, the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts. 

3. ***Interactions***

I have really enjoyed seeing the additional interactions this week from your Week 3 posts. So, we will extend this into this week's ***interactions*** work:

- *Week 4 Replies*. Take a look at the posts you and your classmates made for Week 4 about recommendations made to them and leave replies/feedback/etc. for one another. Please do this by the **end of the day Wednesday**.
- *Week 5 Discussion*. Once you have read about *collective morality*, go back to the readings for last week (Week 4), and re-look at them through this lens. What do you see now that you didn't see before? In what ways does a collective lens reveal things that an individual lens does not? In what ways are the people described in these articles individuals or part of a collective? Share your findings from this experiment with us on Mattermost in the ***Week 5 channel***. Feel free to include screenshots in your post if you like.

[Here is how you would upload images](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/share-files-in-messages.html) to your Mattermost posts.

This work is due by the end of the day on ***Monday, October 7***.
