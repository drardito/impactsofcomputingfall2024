The goal of this final project is for you to apply and expand what you have learned in this course: ethical frameworks, moral taint, collective responsibility, privacy and security, and the impacts of surveillance capitalism, algorithms, and AI.

Here is what you will do:

1. First, you will **pick an area** which you would be interested in doing a deep dive. It could be in an area we have already read about/discussed, or it could be one that we haven’t and that is of interest to you. 

2. Second, you will **create a one-page proposal** for your project. Your proposal should include the area you wish to explore, the questions you would like to ask as you do so, and how you plan on presenting your findings. You will turn this proposal into me and I will give you feedback and a formal acceptance. You will turn in your proposal by uploading it to [this folder](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EtpwDUzpo7BGvlNmGKJulgMBMPbTwttlr38g_8doJuPG6g?e=jjcEy2).  Please submit using a format I can add comments to, like Word documents or Office 365 documents.

3. Third, once your proposal has been accepted, you will **conduct your project**. In doing your work, please use a wide variety of reputable sources. Be sure to keep notes and references as you go so you can share them with us as part of your final materials.

4. Fourth, you will **prepare a presentation** of some kind. This can be a paper, slideshow, video, podcast, artwork, or something else that calls to you. You will share this presentation with all of us. As part of this presentation, please demonstrate how what you have learned specifically connects to the class. Your presentation should include references formatted in the APA 7th style.

This project is **due no later than Friday, December 3rd**.
