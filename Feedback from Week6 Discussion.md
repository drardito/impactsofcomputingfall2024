I found the feedback you left on the feedback I generated for our Mattermost discussions to be very interesting. It provided me with new insights into each of you. Here are some of what you said that both captured others' thoughts and really stuck out to me:

@michelleb -  I suggest that we can include ***open-ended questions*** which can lead to further discussion. [DONE!]
	
@orlandoa1 (in response to @michelleb) - I find it interesting as well that we all tend to ***use experience as a way of connecting with the readings***.

@stefaniewhitmer (in response to @cole.patterson) - I agree that people ***playing devil's advocate*** would be helpful. I wrote in my response that I am struggling to respond to people because I often just agree with them and don't have much else to add to their well written posts. [PLEASE DO THIS!!!]

@custardoliver3 - If our class feedback can be computed down into such measurable statistics like that then truly seemingly ***anything can be distilled into a useable format or algorithm!*** Incredible! [GREAT INSIGHT]



Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 6 Feedback discussion on Mattermost.
