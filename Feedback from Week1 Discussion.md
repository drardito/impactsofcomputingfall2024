I have had the pleasure of reading through your discussion from Week 1 on the (possible) ethical dilemma I posed about a person ahead of you in the supermarket.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. I was really pleased to see so much engagement. It looks like just about all of you posted your responses and then engaged in lots of interactions with your classmates. Most of your posts had replies from 3 or more of your classmates. Well done!

2. ***Substance.*** I thought you collectively did a very nice job wrestling with this scenario and in identifying the criteria you would use to help you make a decision. I was also really pleased by the interactions you had and the ways in which you challenged on another. Also well done!

3. ***Visualizations.*** I like to use computational tools to *analyze* these types of discussions. I think in a couse of the Impacts of Computing, it makes sense (and for possibly interesting discussion) to use these types of computational tools. For this week, I used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  This tells me that your writing was substantive (21 words per sentence), and relatively dense (vocab density). This means to me that you were writing at a good level for this type of class.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. None of this is much of a surprise, since you were all writing about the same scenario. Still, it's good to see that this view of your postings mirrors what we might expect.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=58628ae839b873e526b7a007cd1209fa&query=ethical&query=situation&mode=corpus&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) shows which words are linked to other words. For this analysis, I looked at the two terms *ethical* and *situation.* If you hover those two terms, you will see how they are connected to others. I wonder what you make of this.



Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 1 discussion on Mattermost.
