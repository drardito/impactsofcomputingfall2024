I have had the pleasure of reading through your discussion from Week 1 on the (possible) ethical dilemma I posed about a person ahead of you in the supermarket.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. I was really pleased to see so much engagement. It looks like just about all of you posted your responses and then engaged in lots of interactions with your classmates. Most of your posts had replies from 3 or more of your classmates. Well done!

2. ***Substance.*** I thought you collectively did a very nice job wrestling with this scenario and in identifying the criteria you would use to help you make a decision. I was also really pleased by the interactions you had and the ways in which you challenged on another. Also well done!

3. ***Visualizations.*** I like to use computational tools to *analyze* these types of discussions. I think in a course of the Impacts of Computing, it makes sense (and for possibly interesting discussion) to use these types of computational tools. For this week (and throughout the course), I used/will use [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is a powerful tool designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  By looking at these features of your writing, it is possible to learn some high level characteristics of your work. ***Volume of writing*** is a measurement of the quantity of your collective writing. For this week, you collectively used about 2700 words, of which about 590 were unique. ***Vocabulary density*** is a measure of how rich or varied the vocabulary is in a given text or corpus. A vocabulary density of 0.198 means that, on average, about 19.8% of the words in the corpus are unique. All of this makes sense to me given the specificity of the scenario I designed. We will see how these features develop over the course of the semester.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. None of this is much of a surprise, since you were all writing about the same scenario. Still, it's good to see that this view of your postings mirrors what we might expect. One fun fact is the relatively high frequency of the word "pm," which is taken from the date/time stamp in Mattermost. This suggests that most of your writing is happening in the afternoons/evenings.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* The third time of analysis I performed on your writing for Week 1 is called a ***collocation analysis***, in which we can look at the relationships between works used in your Mattermost posts. In this visualization, thicker grey lines indicate a higher number of connections between terms. I invite you to explore a [live version of this analysis](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=072feac6c1c55e62f1d0296a55b2745d&query=appointment&query=pm&query=items&view=CollocatesGraph), which will allow you to explore these connections in interesting ways.

Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 1 discussion on Mattermost.
