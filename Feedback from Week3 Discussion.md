I have had the pleasure of reviewing the charts you created in response to the readings for Week 3. 

For the most part, they were very well done. The thing that really jumped out at me was the ways that this method of organizing your thoughts revealed issues and impacts in ways that simply writing about them might not have done, or at least not in the same way.

Here is some feedback about those insights.

1. ***Autonomy***. Several of you discussed, very appropriately, the negative impact on autonomy of these surveillance technologies. I encourage you to explore [Self Determination Theory](https://selfdeterminationtheory.org/topics/application-basic-psychological-needs/), which focuses on human autonomy as essential.

2. ***Tension between efficiency and human behavior/performance***. Many of you pointed out the tension between companies/corporations need to be more efficient in order to maximize profit against the human needs for respect and dignity (and being able to freely use a bathroom).

3. ***Students and Learning***. Even though none of the articles focused on students, learning, and classroom, your comments and questions about privacy, dignity and autonomy reminded me how much these tools have been deployed in schools, especially to ensure that students are not cheating through draconian uses of surveillance technologies. You can read more about this topic [here](https://www.ahead.ie/journal/CEOs-Corner-AI-is-here-If-we-fight-it-we-ll-loose-and-so-will-our-studentsl).

Next week, we will go back to the other ways I have provided feedback. 

Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 3 discussion on Mattermost.
