I have had the pleasure of reading through your discussion from Week 4. Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction/Substance***. So much of what you discussed had to with imbalances of power and the impact exerted on us. Here are some highlights:

   

   ***What does it mean to be connected?***
   @michelleb - Social media has influenced the collective moral standards of individuals by influencing many to align their behavior with others online.

   @amelillo2 - By technology connecting one another, it forces people to behave in a way they never have, but they do it because everyone else is doing it. 

   

   ***Who is responsible?***
   @cole.patterson - While the articles from this week show how groups of people must be held collectively morally responsible for the consequences of their decisions. It is true that this data collection enables a company like Meta to train their algorithm and provide you the most interesting posts to look at, but the company has to also be held accountable for the pitfalls of that data collection. 

   @orlandoa1 - I now see it more as a bigger picture, where members work together as a corporation/ group and monitor our everyday life, violating our rights and privacy. Not only are our protection is being violated, lies are being thrown around for content and clickbait

   

   ***How are we affected/impacted?***

   @pisapiat - The outcomes produced by AI can be manipulated to present a reality that may later be proven baseless or fabricated â€“ similar, to the obituary webpage scenario. 

   @emilyramon (in response to @carlos0918) -  If people can have fake obituaries created on their behalf what's stopping companies from using people's information to falsify reviews.

   

2. ***Visualizations.*** As you now know, I like to use computational tools to *analyze* these types of discussions. I think in a course of the Impacts of Computing, it makes sense (and for possibly interesting discussion) to use these types of computational tools. For this week (and throughout the course), I used/will use [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is a powerful tool designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  By looking at these features of your writing, it is possible to learn some high level characteristics of your work. ***Volume of writing*** is a measurement of the quantity of your collective writing. For this week, you collectively used about 3900 words, which less than last week's discussions, of which about 900 were unique, which is close to last week. Despite this change in word count, the quality of the your writing improved this week, which is great. I wonder how much of this is due to having looked at the feedback from previous weeks.  ***Vocabulary density*** is a measure of how rich or varied the vocabulary is in a given text or corpus. A vocabulary density of 0.237 means that, on average, about 24% of the words in the corpus are unique. This is pretty much the same as last week, which indicates that the uniqueness in your writing has reached a new benchmark.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. It is interesting to see the variety of frequently used terms, which seems higher this week, such as: *technology*, *collective*, *group*, *people*, *data*, and *companies*. I attribute this greater variety of frequently used terms to the breadth of your responses to this week's readings. Once again, we see the relatively high frequency of the word *pm*, which is taken from the date/time stamp in Mattermost. This suggests that most of your writing is happening in the afternoons/evenings, as many of you pointed out in posting your feedback on my feedback on your writing.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* As usual, I performed a ***collocation analysis***, in which we can look at the relationships between works used in your Mattermost posts. In this visualization, thicker grey lines indicate a higher number of connections between terms. I invite you to explore a [live version of this analysis](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=4947396d93b7c78d6e64859fe82c0bcf&query=collective&query=lens&query=morality&query=reveals&query=responsibility&query=moral&query=technology&query=looking&query=just&query=ai&query=world&query=way&query=group&query=individual&query=dynamics&query=things&query=social&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph), which will allow you to explore these connections in interesting ways. Be sure to look at the connections between the terms *collective*, *technology*, *responsibility*, and *moral*.  Please do play with the live version. I think you will be surprised by the connections you see there.

Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 5 discussion on Mattermost.
