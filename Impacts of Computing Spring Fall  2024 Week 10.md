This week continues  our work for Unit 3: Computing and Algorithms all the Way Down. In this two-week unit, we will take a deep dive into ***algorithms***: what they are; how they are used; the impact they have on our (digital) lives. The goal of this week is to immerse ourselves in the world of algorithms.


#### Here is the work for Week 10:

1. ***Introduction to Week 10*** - Please listen this to brief audio introduction to Week 10.

2. ***Readings/Listenings/Viewings***

This week, we will do more listening and viewing and a little less reading. 

* ***Viewing*** - The Age or Surveillance Capitalism?

* ***Reading*** - *Abeba Birhane *, [Algorithmic Colonisation of Africa](https://www.theelephant.info/analysis/2020/08/21/algorithmic-colonisation-of-africa/) 

* ***Listening*** - [Rabbit Hole Podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/column/rabbit-hole), episodes “Two: Looking Down” and “Three: Mirror Image.”

As you engage with these texts, listenings, and viewings, please continue take notes using the document and/or folder you created as a part of the work for previous weeks.  As I have said, the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts. 

3. ***Interactions***

I continue to enjoy seeing the additional interactions from last week's posts as well as the posts for the current week's work. This pattern will continue this week as well. So, here is this week's ***interactions*** work:

- *Week 9 (Well, really Week 8) Replies*. Take a look at the posts you and your classmates made for Week 9 about ***algorithms and rabbit holes***, and leave replies/feedback/etc. for one another. Please do this by the **end of the day Wednesday November 6**.
- *Week 10 Discussion*. Now that you have done the readings/viewings/listenings for this week, please share your thoughts with us on Mattermost in the ***Week 10 channel***. I very much look forward to your thoughts about algorithms.

This work is due by the end of the day on ***Monday,  November 11***.
