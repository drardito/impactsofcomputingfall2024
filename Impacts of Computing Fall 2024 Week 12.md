This week continues our work for Unit 4: AI for Good or Ill. In this two-week unit, we will take a deep dive into ***artificial intelligence*** and how it is used to make decisions about and for us in the criminal justice and health care systems, as a way to explore the ethical and moral dilemmas associated with each


#### Here is the work for Week 12:

1. ***Introduction to Week 12*** - Please listen this to brief audio introduction to Week 12 in which we explore AI and the health care system.

* ***Readings*** - 

  * [GAO, Artificial Intelligence in Health Care: ](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-7sp)[Benefits and Challenges of Technologies to Augment Patient Care](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-7sp) [This is a link to the web page for this GAO report. Please read over the web page and note its structure]

  * GAO Report [[Part 1: Background, Promise, and Challenges](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3jixzsl3lf4ck2j/gao-21-7sp.pdf?dl=0) (pp. 1-40]

* ***Listening*** - none this week

As you engage with these texts, listenings, and viewings, please continue take notes using the document and/or folder you created as a part of the work for previous weeks.  As I have said, the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts. 

3. ***Interactions***

I continue to enjoy seeing the additional interactions from last week's posts as well as the posts for the current week's work. This pattern will continue this week as well. So, here is this week's ***interactions*** work:

- *Week 11 Replies*. Take a look at the posts you and your classmates made for Week 10 about ***AI and the criminal justice system***, and leave replies/feedback/etc. for one another. Please do this by the **end of the day Wednesday November 20**.
- *Week 12 Discussion*. Now that you have done the readings/viewings/listenings for this week, please share your thoughts with us on Mattermost in the ***Week 12 channel***. I very much look forward to your thoughts about algorithms.

This work is due by the end of the day on ***Monday,  November 25***.
