I have had the pleasure of reading through your discussion from Week 4. Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction/Substance***. While there was a decrease in interaction between you on Mattermost this week, there were some very substantive and thought-provoking responses. There was a big increase in both the amount and quality of interaction between all of you this week. Here are some examples.

   - Many of you did a terrific job summarizing each of the three ethical frameworks. Here are two examples, among many:

   ***The good and the bad***.
   @cole.patterson 

   > Transparently, I think that these algorithms can be good. They help me find more things that I'm inclined to like on social media. OR it could help me find a good deal while shopping online. The part that worries me, is if these companies can show me that they can control each and every thing that I see online, what can they do behind the scenes.

   @nivard 

   > What really struck me in this week’s readings was the criticism of systems, both real and imaginary, that put security ahead of personal choice. 

   ***Balancing benefits with concerns about being manipulated:***

   @timponeg 

   > By collecting vast amounts of data on user behavior, companies create detailed profiles that allow them to predict and influence user actions. This not only raises privacy concerns but also manipulates user choices in ways they might not consciously recognize.

   @orlandoa1 

   > There are many pros and cons of surveillance and security as it does help in authority cases such as crime and illegal usage. However, there are components that may deem as overbearing due to lack of privacy that may deny protection laws. 

   ***How bad is it?***

   @livvmeyer 

   > After reading these articles, it's really not far-fetched at all to believe that these big apps and companies use not only the information you search for within the app but also the conversations you have outside of it to cater the algorithm and its ads to your interests. 

   @ally.mw 

   > I also notice how there is a sort of psychological manipulation due to data collection that causes people to be on their phones more because videos or ads pop up that interest us, which can lead to falling behind in school, work, and can cause sleep deprivation or mental health issues in the long run.

   @stefaniewhitmer 

   > Again, in the documentary Coded Bias, they explore how China is using their AI for mostly government surveillance. Citizens have a social credit score which fluctuates based on “good citizen” behavior. Then certain privileges (such as riding public transportation) will be revoked if your social credit score is too low.

2. ***Visualizations.*** As you now know, I like to use computational tools to *analyze* these types of discussions. I think in a course of the Impacts of Computing, it makes sense (and for possibly interesting discussion) to use these types of computational tools. For this week (and throughout the course), I used/will use [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is a powerful tool designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  By looking at these features of your writing, it is possible to learn some high level characteristics of your work. ***Volume of writing*** is a measurement of the quantity of your collective writing. For this week, you collectively used about 4700 words, which is a 100% decrease over last week's discussions, of which about 1100 were unique, which is very similar to last week. I am not entirely sure how to account for the reduced word count. Some is perhaps due to not restating what you had done the previous week, as you did for Week 3. ***Vocabulary density*** is a measure of how rich or varied the vocabulary is in a given text or corpus. A vocabulary density of 0.238 means that, on average, about 24% of the words in the corpus are unique. This is double the level of vocabulary density from the previous weeks, and suggests that your writing is becoming more complex and nuanced. We will continue to see how these features develop over the course of the semester.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. We can once again see the assignment reflection in some of these terms, such as *companies*, *technology*, and *data*. Oddly, the term *privacy* is missing and the related terms *privacy* and *security* are used only infrequently. None of this is much of a surprise, since you were all writing about the same scenario. Once again, we see the relatively high frequency of the word *pm*, which is taken from the date/time stamp in Mattermost. This suggests that most of your writing is happening in the afternoons/evenings.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* The third time of analysis I performed on your writing for Week 1 is called a ***collocation analysis***, in which we can look at the relationships between works used in your Mattermost posts. In this visualization, thicker grey lines indicate a higher number of connections between terms. I invite you to explore a [live version of this analysis](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=c257a09c1e6039205f7ed867e3e56d14&query=data&query=companies&query=collection&query=use&query=like&query=facebook&query=pm&query=wednesday&query=agree&query=think&query=tuesday&query=technology&query=people%27s&query=user&query=access&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph), which will allow you to explore these connections in interesting ways. Be sure to look at the connections between the terms *technology*, *people's*, and *companies*.

Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 4 discussion on Mattermost.
