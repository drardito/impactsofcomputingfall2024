I have had the pleasure of reading through your discussion from Week 2 as you revisited your responses to the Week 1 scenario through the lenses of the three ethical frameworks introduced.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction/Substance***. There was a big increase in both the amount and quality of interaction between all of you this week. Here are some examples.

   - Many of you did a terrific job summarizing each of the three ethical frameworks. Here are two examples, among many:

   Cole (@cole.patterson) did an excellent job breaking down the scenario via each of the ethical frameworks, especially here: "I would say that allowing everyone to cut the line whenever they are running late to something is not a rule that can be universally applied, if it was then what would be the point in the line."

   Ginna (@timponeg) also succinctly distinguished each of the ethical frameworks: "According to Aristotle, making decisions when we are in situations from week #1, it is all about finding a “good” way or doing the right thing while still making such an ethical decision." "Utilitarianism deals with more consequences, being morally right or wrong, depending on the situation you are in and how they affect others around you." "Deontology on the other hand focuses more on the actions. It determines what makes such actions right or wrong."

   - The posts and discussions (in your replies and comments to/with one another were really interesting. For example:

   @stefaniewhitmer in response to @cole.patterson pointed out: "Cole you make a really interesting point -- that the argument to ask the person in front of you could be argued either way under utilitarianism." Here comment here introduces the idea of relativity or perspective in understanding and applying these and other ethical frameworks.

   @@mboggi8 in response to @carlos0918 replied: "I did not think about weighing the chances and probability of the person in line letting me cut in the Utilitarian approach. I like how you weighed the scenario in both lights, in terms of if it works out and if it does not work out which truly highlights the weighing of costs and benefits in Utilitarianism."

   @ally.mw brought up the hugely important impact of cultural differences and understandings in the examination of ethical and moral choices and impacts: "The chapters touch on several culture's ideas on their ethics and how they may practice them differently than us, or each other. I also think there isn't a correct or a wrong answer to the original question, since it really is according to the person on what they would do in the situation, whether it be leaving the store and going back later or finding another way around the wait."

2. I was really pleased to see so much engagement. It looks like just about all of you posted your responses and then engaged in lots of interactions with your classmates. Most of your posts had replies from 3 or more of your classmates. Well done!

3. ***Substance.*** I thought you collectively did a very nice job wrestling with this scenario and in identifying the criteria you would use to help you make a decision. I was also really pleased by the interactions you had and the ways in which you challenged on another. Also well done!

4. ***Visualizations.*** I like to use computational tools to *analyze* these types of discussions. I think in a course of the Impacts of Computing, it makes sense (and for possibly interesting discussion) to use these types of computational tools. For this week (and throughout the course), I used/will use [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is a powerful tool designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  By looking at these features of your writing, it is possible to learn some high level characteristics of your work. ***Volume of writing*** is a measurement of the quantity of your collective writing. For this week, you collectively used about 2700 words, of which about 590 were unique. ***Vocabulary density*** is a measure of how rich or varied the vocabulary is in a given text or corpus. A vocabulary density of 0.198 means that, on average, about 19.8% of the words in the corpus are unique. All of this makes sense to me given the specificity of the scenario I designed. We will see how these features develop over the course of the semester.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. None of this is much of a surprise, since you were all writing about the same scenario. Still, it's good to see that this view of your postings mirrors what we might expect. One fun fact is the relatively high frequency of the word "pm," which is taken from the date/time stamp in Mattermost. This suggests that most of your writing is happening in the afternoons/evenings.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* The third time of analysis I performed on your writing for Week 1 is called a ***collocation analysis***, in which we can look at the relationships between works used in your Mattermost posts. In this visualization, thicker grey lines indicate a higher number of connections between terms. I invite you to explore a [live version of this analysis](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=072feac6c1c55e62f1d0296a55b2745d&query=appointment&query=pm&query=items&view=CollocatesGraph), which will allow you to explore these connections in interesting ways.

Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 1 discussion on Mattermost.
