2. ***Readings/Listenings/Viewings***

This week, we will do more listening and viewing and a little less reading. 

* ***Viewing*** - 

  * Tressie McMillan Cottom on [AI, Politics, and Inequality](https://www.instagram.com/tressiemcphd/reel/DBKllBxIAJh/?ref=2ndbreakfast.audreywatters.com).
  * Torrey Trust, [GEN AI & Ethics: Investigating ChatGPT](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EfuQ5FAPsphPh7X2ZAeBP00Bsw_RE5TTNgIm3FbK73ofsw?e=gJLNZAg), Gemini, and Copilot (presentation)

As you engage with these texts, listenings, and viewings, please continue take notes using the document and/or folder you created as a part of the work for previous weeks.  As I have said, the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts. 

3. ***Interactions***

I continue to enjoy seeing the additional interactions from last week's posts as well as the posts for the current week's work. This pattern will continue this week as well. So, here is this week's ***interactions*** work:

- *Week 10 Replies*. Take a look at the posts you and your classmates made for Week 10 about ***surveillance capitalism and rabbit holes***, and leave replies/feedback/etc. for one another. Please do this by the **end of the day Wednesday**.
- *Week 11 Discussion*. Once you have done the readings/viewings/listenings for this week, please share your thoughts with us on Mattermost in the ***Week 11 channel***. I very much look forward to your thoughts about how AI is being used.

This work is due by the end of the day on ***Monday,  November 18***.
