This week begins our work for Unit 3: Computing and Algorithms all the Way Down. In this two-week unit, we will take a deep dive into ***algorithms***: what they are; how they are used; the impact they have on our (digital) lives. The goal of this week is to immerse ourselves in the world of algorithms.


#### Here is the work for Week 9:

1. ***Introduction to Unit 3*** - Please listen to the brief audio introduction to Unit 3, which you can find here.
1. ***Introduction to Week 9*** - Please listen this to brief audio introduction to Week 9. [Remember we really spent two weeks on Week 7]

2. ***Readings/Listenings/Viewings***

This week, we will do more listening and viewing and a little less reading. 

* ***Viewing*** - *Explainer Video*: What is an algorithm?

* ***Reading*** - *Sandra Nelson, Annette Vee*, [The view from "Zoom University": surveillance and control in higher ed's pandemic pedagogy pivot.](https://sussex.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/The_view_from_Zoom_University_surveillance_and_control_in_higher_ed_s_pandemic_pedagogy_pivot/23490788 ) You can use the Download link.

* ***Listening*** - [Rabbit Hole Podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/podcasts/rabbit-hole-prologue.html), episodes “Start Here” and “One: Wonderland.”

As you engage with these texts, listenings, and viewings, please continue take notes using the document and/or folder you created as a part of the work for previous weeks.  As I have said, the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts. 

3. ***Interactions***

I continue to enjoy seeing the additional interactions from last week's posts as well as the posts for the current week's work. This pattern will continue this week as well. So, here is this week's ***interactions*** work:

- *Week 9 Discussion*. Now that you have done the readings/viewings/listenings for this week, please share your thoughts with us on Mattermost in the ***Week 9 channel***. I very much look forward to your thoughts about algorithms.

This work is due by the end of the day on ***Monday,  November 4***.
